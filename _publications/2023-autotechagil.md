excerpt: 'Future mobility will be electrified, connected and automated. 
This opens completely new possibilities for mobility concepts that have the chance to improve not only the quality of life but also road safety for everyone. 
To achieve this, a transformation of the transportation system as we know it today is necessary. 
The UNICARagil project, which ran from 2018 to 2023, has produced architectures for driverless vehicles that were demonstrated in four full-scale automated vehicle prototypes for different applications. 
The AUTOtech.agil project builds upon these results and extends the system boundaries from the vehicles to include the whole intelligent transport system (ITS) comprising, e.g., roadside units, coordinating instances and cloud backends. 
The consortium was extended mainly by industry partners, including OEMs and tier 1 suppliers with the goal to synchronize the concepts developed in the university-driven UNICARagil project with the automotive industry. 
Three significant use cases of future mobility motivate the consortium to develop a vision for a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS), in which entities are highly connected and continually learning. 
The proposed software ecosystem is the foundation for the complex software engineering task that is required to realize such a system. 
Embedded in this ecosystem, a modular kit of robust service-oriented modules along the effect chain of vehicle automation as well as cooperative and collective functions are developed. 
The modules shall be deployed in a service-oriented E/E platform. 
In AUTOtech.agil, standardized interfaces and development tools for such platforms are developed. 
Additionally, the project focuses on continuous uncertainty consideration expressed as quality vectors. 
A consistent safety and security concept shall pave the way for the homologation of the researched ITS.'
