title: "SceneMotion: From Agent-centric Embeddings to Scene-wide Forecasts"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-scenemotion
excerpt: 'Self-driving vehicles rely on multimodal motion forecasts to effectively interact with their environment and plan safe maneuvers. 
We introduce SceneMotion, an attention-based model for forecasting scene-wide motion modes of multiple traffic agents. 
Our model transforms local agent-centric embeddings into scene-wide forecasts using a novel latent context module. 
Our latent context module learns a scene-wide latent space from multiple agent-centric embeddings, enabling joint predictions and interaction modeling. 
The competitive performance in the Waymo Open Interaction Prediction Challenge demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. 
Furthermore, we use our scene-wide forecasts to identify areas where future interaction between agents is likely, enriching the contextual information for motion planners.'
